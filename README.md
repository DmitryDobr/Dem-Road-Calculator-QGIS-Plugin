### Calculate slope and aspect along road lines using DEM

The module is designed to calculate the average slope and exposure values for roads represented by a linear vector layer based on DEM. The tool is designed to work with roads in forestry. You should not use it on roads with engineering structures if you do not have access to high-precision terrain data
